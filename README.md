# Welcome to ReMart Ecommerce Platform Prototype Repository
This was originally an academic project to develop a mobile application.<br>
Although this was completed quite some time ago, ReMart originally had these features (the dependencies and APIs have expired...)

* Users can create accounts to buy and sell items. (With Firebase APIs).
* Users could change their account information and profile pictures.
* Image and account hosting with Firebase.
* Users could change their item listings details or delete their item listing entirely.
